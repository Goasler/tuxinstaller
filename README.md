# tuxinstaller
I install new Linux machines in VM or IRL very often and dont wanna miss my prefered Programs.  
I also don't want to have to remember them all the time and I don't want to install them manually every time.  


Please consider:
1. This is my second script that i ever uploaded to github. 
2. I know that there are already similar programs. 

  
 
## Edit the Config file
Write in each new line the exact name of a package that you want to install or remove.
```
nano tuxinstaller_install.conf
nano tuxinstaller_remove.conf
```
or if you prefer vi
```
vi tuxinstaller_install.conf
vi tuxinstaller_remove.conf
```
   
   
## Usage (onetime)
```
tuxinstaller
```
